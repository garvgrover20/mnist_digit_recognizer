## 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognizer

Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

This project is a great introduction to image classification and deep learning. It walks through the process of building a CNN model that can accurately identify digits (0–9) from grayscale images, making it perfect for anyone learning about:

- 🔢 Digit classification  
- 🖼️ Image processing  
- 🧱 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- 📚 Working with the MNIST dataset
